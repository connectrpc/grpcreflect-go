`connectrpc.com/grpcreflect` adds support for gRPC's server reflection API to any
`net/http` server &mdash; including those built with [Connect][connect]. With
server reflection enabled, ad-hoc debugging tools can call your gRPC-compatible
handlers and print the responses *without* a copy of the schema.

The exposed reflection API is wire compatible with Google's gRPC
implementations, so it works with [grpcurl], [grpcui], [BloomRPC], and many
other tools.

For more on Connect, see the [announcement blog post][blog], the documentation
on [connectrpc.com][docs] (especially the [Getting Started] guide for Go), the
[Connect][connect] repo, or the [demo service][examples-go].

## Example

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "golang.org/x/net/http2"
  "golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c"
  "connectrpc.com/grpcreflect"
)

func main() {
  mux := http.NewServeMux()
  reflector := grpcreflect.NewStaticReflector(
    "acme.user.v1.UserService",
    "acme.group.v1.GroupService",
    // protoc-gen-connect-go generates package-level constants
    // for these fully-qualified protobuf service names, so you'd more likely
    // reference userv1.UserServiceName and groupv1.GroupServiceName.
  )
  mux.Handle(grpcreflect.NewHandlerV1(reflector))
  // Many tools still expect the older version of the server reflection API, so
  // most servers should mount both handlers.
  mux.Handle(grpcreflect.NewHandlerV1Alpha(reflector))
  // If you don't need to support HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c), you can drop
  // x/net/http2 and use http.ListenAndServeTLS instead.
  http.ListenAndServe(
    ":8080",
    h2c.NewHandler(mux, &http2.Server{}),
  )
}
```

## Status: Stable

This module is stable. It supports:

* The three most recent major releases of Go. Keep in mind that [only the last
  two releases receive security patches][go-support-policy].
* [APIv2] of Protocol Buffers in Go (`google.golang.org/protobuf`).

Within those parameters, `grpcreflect` follows semantic versioning.
We will _not_ make breaking changes in the 1.x series of releases.
